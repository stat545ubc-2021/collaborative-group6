STAT 545A Collaborative Project - Group 6
=================================

💻**Overview**💻
 
This is the private repository of **group 6** for their collaborative project as part of STAT 545A.
This project is an essential part of the course and a learning tool for RStudio projects, workflow, version control with Git and collaboration via GitHub. 

The aim is to create a GitHub repository and collaborate with teammates to work on milestones of the project using git and GitHub workflow. To efficiently complete this project, teammates will delegate tasks to each other. The discussion about project files will be done by writing GitHub issues. Each member will mention another member in the issue or pull requestes so that it gets reviewed easily (for eg: issue raised by Sudha will be reviewed by Maira @maira1220).
